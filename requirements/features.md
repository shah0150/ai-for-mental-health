# Core Features and Cost/Value Analysis

### The Chatbot

We could not determine the priorities of features until our client returned to the city.
Of the possible uses of AI for mental health, this is where to start.

- cost of research 100 points
- cost of design 100 points
- cost of development 100 points
- necessary


### Bipolar Disorder Questionnaire

Besides general chat capabilities, we need to address the needs of persons with bipolar disorder.  
This could be thought of as an add-on module that is an extra set of language.
We will need to encourage answering a few specific questions on a regular basis.
It might be 9 questions every two weeks.

- cost of research 100 points
- cost of development 50 points
- necessary

### Doctors' Dashboard - Patient Accounts

This will not be: user alone with an AI.  We can best take advantage of text analytics if combined with a human professional.  The doctor is saving time and getting a type of data which compliments in-person visits.

- cost of design 10 points
- necessary

This feature requires CRUD operations.

- cost of development 10 points
- necessary

Progress notes will allow a doctor to record observations.

- cost of development 1 point
- value unknown


### Account Registration

Accounts must be connected to a specific mobile device.
This could be done by sending a verification code to the patients phone by SMS.
On the dashboard side:

- cost of design 5 points
- cost of development 5 points
- value 20 points

On the mobile device
this will have to be integrated with a privacy/terms agreement.
It could flow into a chat based preference setting process.

- cost of design 10 points
- cost of development 5 points
- necessary

There will have to be one administration account which does not manage patient accounts.
Instead it manages doctor accounts.
It may have to be a named person account to comply with PIPEDA auditability type stuff.

- cost of development 10 points
- necessary?


### Doctors' Dashboard - Word Cloud

It is too much to begin features that analyze trends in mood.
We can not diagnose.  We should not think that we can.
We can enhance a licensed doctor's knowledge of a patient by showing patterns detected in chats with the bot.

- cost of design 10 points
- cost of development 10 points
- value 50 points

Alerts could be sent to the doctor if a patient's state of mind is detected from word analysis to possibly be critical.

- cost of design 5 points
- cost of development 10 points
- necessary

A sentiment chart would have to be clear.  What is being measured?

- cost of research 20 points
- cost of development 10 points


### Rewarding Participation

This feature did not take shape until it was brought up in a project status meeting.  People riffed on what could keep users coming back to the app.  We already knew an animal avatar for the bot would not be avoided like if it had an image of a robot or of a doctor.  Now we chose a pattern from games where a user can purchase equipment for a character.

- cost of design 100 points
- cost of development 10 point
- value 100 points


### Change Mobile App Preferences

Colour theme, the name the bear calls you...

- cost of design 5 point
- cost of development 1 point
- value 10 points


### Face/Emotion Recognition

This could be an alternate medium to the chats for tracking moods.  Another use for face recognition discussed with client was for identifying the user such that doctor can confirm that it is their patient.

- cost of design 20 points
- cost of development 50 points
- value unknown


### Locking Chat History

I had privacy in mind from the start.
I am still unsure of the big data intentions of various language analytics services.
I got some advice to lookup HIPAA and similar local policies.
It will become clear how much to store on the user's own mobile device and how much we should trust them to lock their device.

- cost of design 1 point
- cost of development 1 point
- value depends of PIPEDA


### Emergency Services Contacts

This is a list of services appropriate to patients geographic area and personal issues.
Phones might have a lock screen that allows calls to specific numbers.
Maybe this app could be allowed to add to that list?

- cost of research 10 points
- cost of development 10 points
- value unknown


### Colouring Book

Colouring is an enjoyable activity and an opportunity for mood detections.
Line drawings and a colour palette.

- cost of development 100 points
- cost of design 100 points
- value unknown


### A Variety of Avatars

This could be created in the future.

- cost of design 100 points
- cost of development 1 point

This could be released in conjunction with other specialized AI for mental health modules.

- cost of research 1000 points
- cost of development 100 points
- value 1000 points


### More For Contemplation

Although notifications could easily be sent from doctor to patient directly, this is a type of feature has not been explored.  The patient will be aware of doctor's ability to view text, but how would this effect user experience?
"A spot has opened up in your doctors schedule.  Would you like to book on [this day] at [this hour]?"

- value unknown
- cost of development 10 points

Patient dashboard could be integrated with other medical information systems.  It could be useful to review patient history.

- cost of research 100 points
- cost of development unknown

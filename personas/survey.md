# Help Us Design an App!

We're a team of students at Algonquin College working on creating an app that creates a patient/doctor interface. It utilizes a chatbot to track the patients manic/depressive phases and sends the data back to the doctor for analysis. Our app will encourage self assessment, track moods and help manage symptoms in a friendly and approachable way.

This survey will take approximately 2-3 mins to complete.

All questions are optional, but the more feedback we get the more it will help us design the best app possible!  You can see what we create this April.  For more information contact kerr0215@algonquinlive.com.

Your answers will be kept strictly confidential and will only be used anonymously in aggregate.

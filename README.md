# OSO

"OSO" is a patient to provider platform that makes health diagnosis for bipolar patients more transparent and data-driven.  Using chatbot technology, a mobile application is used to collect information from the patient.  Then using machine learning and artificial intelligence, the results are carefully shown on a dashboard for the provider.
